summary: "v0.5.1 released with changes to rotations, better error detection, and drag modifiers"
---

Parme version `0.5.1` has been released. 

**Warning**: Emitter logic definition files that were previously created may not be compatible with 0.5.1.

## Changes

* Changed rotations from being a modifier to instead be an initializer that affects rotational velocity.  
  * This change is *NOT* backwards compatible.  Any emitter logic definitions that utilize the old `ConstantRotationModifier` will no longer load nor compile.
* Added a new random rotational velocity initializer, that allows particles to have randomized rotations within a specified degree per second range (including negative).
* Better error detection and more visible error notifications in the FlatRedBall Glue Plugin
* Added a new modifier to apply drag to particles
