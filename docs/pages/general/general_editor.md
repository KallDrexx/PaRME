Parme contains an easy to use editor that allows for instant feedback of changes in particle behavior.  The editor only supports Windows for the time being, but there are future plans to make it more multi-platform.

**Warning**: The editor will immediately exit if the window is closed, even if unsaved changes are present.  It's important to save prior to quitting.
